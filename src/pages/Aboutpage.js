        The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by
        9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous) It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able
        to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The
        human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. (Marvin
        Minsky) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) That’s the thing
        about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is
        lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) Just remember: you’re not a ‘dummy,’ no
        matter what those computer books claim. The real dummies are the people
        who–though technically expert–couldn’t design hardware and software
        that’s usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it.
        (Walter Mossberg)

        Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork. (Sam
        Ewing) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it
        for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) Fifty years of programming
        language research, and we end up with C++? (Richard A. O’Keefe) The best
        method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8
        m/s2. (Anonymous) There’s an old story about the person who wished his
        computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true,
        since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup)
